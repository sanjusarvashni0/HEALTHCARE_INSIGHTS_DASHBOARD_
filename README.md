# HEALTHCARE_INSIGHTS_DASHBOARD_

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an end-to-end healthcare analytics dashboard to uncover insights from patient demographics, treatment patterns, and hospital facility usage. It combines SQL, Python, and Streamlit to support hospital administrators in making data-driven decisions and optimizing operational efficiency.
🧠 Key Objectives

  - Analyze patient demographics (age, gender, location) to detect trends

    Identify most frequent diagnoses, treatments, and peak admission times

    Monitor healthcare facility utilization (e.g., bed occupancy, length of stay)

    Deliver real-time insights through an interactive dashboard

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

    Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

    SQL: MySQL/PostgreSQL

    Streamlit: Dashboard creation

    Jupyter Notebook / VS Code: Development environment

🧩 Project Workflow

    Data Understanding: Explored healthcare dataset to identify structure and relevant features

    Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized data types, and formatted timestamps

    Database Integration: Structured and loaded data into SQL tables with indexing for query optimization

    Query Development: Created 15+ analytical queries for trends in admissions, diagnoses, and service use

    Dashboard Development: Built an interactive Streamlit app to visualize insights dynamically

📈 Sample Insights

    Identified top 5 diagnoses and monthly admission peaks

    Analyzed bed occupancy patterns to improve patient flow

    Detected seasonal trends in service demand
